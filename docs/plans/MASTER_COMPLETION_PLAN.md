# Master Feature Completion Plan

This document serves as the single source of truth for the remaining implementation tasks to reach Release Candidate (RC1) status.

---

## 1. Video Infrastructure

### 1.1 Video Backend (Cloud Functions)

- [x] **Implement `generateVideoFn` in `functions/src/index.ts`**
  - Replace placeholder with Vertex AI Veo-3.1 API integration.
  - Handle parameters: prompt, aspect ratio, duration.
  - Implement signed URL generation for output storage.
  - Add error handling and retry logic.
- [x] **Job Status Management**
  - Implement status updates to Firestore (`videoJobs` collection).
  - Track states: `queued`, `processing`, `complete`, `failed`.

### 1.2 Video Studio Export (Frontend)

- [x] **Implement Local Rendering Service**
  - Create `src/services/video/RenderService.ts`.
  - Use `@remotion/renderer` (or browser-based equivalent if Node not available) to render compositions.
  - _Note:_ Since this is a browser/electron app, we might need to rely on the Cloud Function for high-quality rendering, or a local FFMPEG binary if Electron-capable. The plan suggests "Local Rendering Service" but also "Backend API Setup". We will prioritize the Backend API (Veo) first as it's the AI generation part, then look at composition rendering.
