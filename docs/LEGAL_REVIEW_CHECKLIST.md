# Legal Review Checklist — indiiOS Pre-Launch

> **How to use this doc:** Two sections — things only **you (the founder)** can
> decide or action, and things that need an **attorney** to draft. Work through
> the founder section first; the attorney needs your answers before they can
> write anything.
>
> **The scaffolds live in:** `src/modules/legal/pages/LegalPages.tsx`
> Replace every `[ATTORNEY_REVIEW_REQUIRED]`, `[DATE_TBD]`, etc. with finalized
> text when done, then remove the amber "⚠️ Draft" banners.
>
> **How to verify nothing was missed:** `grep -r "ATTORNEY_REVIEW_REQUIRED\|DATE_TBD\|DESIGNATED_AGENT\|REGISTERED_ADDRESS\|PHONE_NUMBER" src/modules/legal/`

## PART 1 — FOUNDER DECISIONS (Only you can answer these)

These are not legal drafting tasks. They are business decisions the attorney
will need before they can write a single sentence. Gather these first.

### Business & Company Info

| # | Decision / Info needed | Your answer |
|---|------------------------|-------------|
| F1 | **Launch date** — What is the actual go-live date? Needed for "Effective date" on all legal docs. | `___________` |
| F2 | **Company registered address** — The official LLC address on file with the state. | `___________` |
| F3 | **DMCA designated agent** — Who at IndiiOS LLC will receive copyright takedown notices? (Can be you, a co-founder, or a registered agent service.) | `___________` |
| F4 | **Contact phone for DMCA agent** — Required by the Copyright Office for DMCA safe harbor registration. | `___________` |
| F5 | **Governing state** — Michigan is assumed (Detroit-area LLC). Confirm or correct. | Michigan / other: `___` |
| F6 | **Dispute resolution preference** — Arbitration (cheaper, limits class actions) or standard litigation? This is a business call, not a legal one. | `___________` |
| F7 | **Are you targeting EU users at launch?** — If yes, GDPR data controller registration may be required before day one. | Yes / No |
| F8 | **Data retention preference** — How long should user data be kept after account deletion? (Common: 30 days for accounts, 7 years for payment records.) | `___________` |

### AI Copyright — Platform Policy Decisions

This section is brand new law (Copyright Office, January–March 2025). The
ruling is clear on the spectrum:

> **Fully AI-generated → no copyright.** A user who just types a prompt and
> publishes the output owns nothing.
>
> **AI-assisted with human creative control → copyrightable.** A user who
> uploads their own photo and changes the background owns the result. A user
> who uses AI-generated stems but makes arrangement, selection, and composition
> decisions owns the song they built.

The line: **human decision-making applied to the output.** A prompt alone
is not enough. Selecting, arranging, modifying, or composing with AI outputs is.

You need to decide the platform's stance on each of the following before the
attorney can draft §4 and §5 of the ToS:

| # | Decision needed | Options | Your call |
|---|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| F9 | **Purely prompt-generated tracks** — Will indiiOS allow users to distribute music that was 100% AI-generated (no human arrangement/composition)? | (a) Allow with mandatory disclosure; (b) Block entirely; (c) Allow but warn user they have no copyright | `___________` |
| F10 | **AI disclosure at distribution time** — Will the distribution flow require users to declare AI involvement before sending to DSPs? DistroKid requires it; TuneCore rejects 100% AI tracks outright. | (a) Mandatory disclosure checkbox; (b) Optional; (c) Mirror DistroKid's model exactly | `___________` |
| F11 | **Platform's copyright warranty** — Do you want users to warrant (promise, under penalty of account termination) that they have a valid copyright claim before distributing? | (a) Yes, required before every release; (b) Yes, one-time on account creation; (c) No warranty required | `___________` |
| F12 | **AI image ownership** — For images generated in the Creative Studio: does indiiOS claim any license to those images, or does it all belong to the user? | (a) User owns all; (b) User owns, platform gets a non-exclusive license to display/thumbnail; (c) Attorney to advise | `___________` |
| F13 | **Gemini downstream restrictions** — Google's ToS restricts some uses of Gemini outputs. Do you want the attorney to review Google's current AI ToS and flow restrictions down to users, or keep it simple and just say "comply with Google's terms"? | (a) Full review + custom clauses; (b) Pass-through reference to Google ToS | `___________` |

### Email Infrastructure (Do this yourself — 10 minutes)

| # | Task | Status |
|---|------|--------|
| F14 | Create `legal@indiios.com` and forward to your inbox | [ ] |
| F15 | Create `privacy@indiios.com` and forward to your inbox | [ ] |
| F16 | Create `dmca@indiios.com` and forward to whoever handles takedowns | [ ] |
| F17 | Register DMCA agent at **copyright.gov/dmca-directory** — $6/year, 10 minutes. Required for DMCA safe harbor (17 U.S.C. § 512). Without this, you lose safe harbor protection. | [ ] |

### Production Infrastructure (Engineering — not legal)

| # | Task | How |
|---|------|-----|
| F18 | Add real Stripe price IDs to Cloud Functions environment | `firebase functions:config:set stripe.price_pro_monthly=price_xxx` etc. |
| F19 | Set `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_CHECK_KEY` in production environment | Prevents API abuse. Currently optional; required before production. |

## PART 2 — ATTORNEY TASKS (Bring your answers from Part 1)

**Attorney type:** Startup/tech attorney with music industry experience.
Options: Cowan DeBaets (music-focused, NYC), Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts
(affordable), or a general startup firm (Cooley, Gunderson, Clerky) for the
tech side + a music attorney for DSP/distribution clauses.
**Budget estimate:** $2,000–$8,000 for ToS + Privacy bundle; music-specific
clauses (DSP sub-distribution, AI content) may add cost.

### Terms of Service — Attorney Drafts

| # | Section in LegalPages.tsx | What to give the attorney | Legal work required |
|---|--------------------------|---------------------------|---------------------|

### DMCA Policy — Attorney Reviews

| # | Item | What to give the attorney |
|---|------|---------------------------|

## AI Copyright — Reference Card for the Attorney

> Give this section to your attorney when they draft §4 and §5.

**Current law (as of March 2025):**

| Scenario | Copyrightable? | Basis |
|----------|----------------|-------|
| User types prompt → AI generates image/song, published as-is | **No** | *Thaler v. Perlmutter* (D.C. Circuit, March 2025); Copyright Office Part 2 Report (Jan 2025) |
| User uploads their own photo + AI changes the background | **Yes** | Human authorship in original photo + creative approval of changes |
| User uses AI-generated audio stems + makes arrangement/composition decisions | **Yes** | Human creative control over arrangement and selection qualifies as authorship |
| User generates AI stems with prompts, no further editing | **No** | Prompts alone ≠ human authorship |
| User generates AI stems + curates/arranges into an album | **Partial** | Album as a "collective work" may be copyrightable; individual AI stems are not |

**DSP disclosure landscape (what the platform needs to align with):**
- DistroKid: AI disclosure checkbox + description of human contribution → **required**
- TuneCore: Declares AI involvement in composition/mastering → **required**; rejects 100% AI tracks
- CD Baby: Rejects 100% AI-generated music
- Spotify: Voluntary supply-chain metadata disclosure (for now)
- Deezer: Automatic AI detection, auto-labels tracks

**What the platform needs in-app (for the engineer, not the attorney):**
- An AI disclosure step in the distribution flow (before sending to DSPs)
- A checkbox: "This release contains AI-generated content" + description field
- A copyright warranty checkbox: "I confirm I have human authorship over the creative decisions in this release"
- Platform-level block or warning when user tries to distribute a track flagged as 100% AI

---

## How to Close This Checklist

1. Complete all **F items** in Part 1 — decisions only you can make
2. Register DMCA agent at copyright.gov (F17) — do this now, it takes 10 min
3. Set up email aliases (F14–F16)
4. Brief the attorney with your Part 1 answers + the AI reference card above
5. Attorney returns finalized language → update `LegalPages.tsx`
6. Remove amber "⚠️ Draft" banners from each legal component
7. Run: `grep -r "ATTORNEY_REVIEW_REQUIRED\|DATE_TBD\|DESIGNATED_AGENT\|REGISTERED_ADDRESS\|PHONE_NUMBER" src/modules/legal/` — should return zero results

When that grep returns nothing, the legal P0 is cleared.

## Attorney Partnership Strategy — Featured Attorney + Marketplace Model

> **TL;DR:** Approach the music business YouTuber attorney about a
> partnership deal where she is the *featured/default attorney* on the
> platform. She gets a prominent, paying slot with inbound client leads.
> Users who want someone different can search a broader directory. Her
> audience becomes a marketing channel; the platform becomes a client
> source for her firm. Everyone wins.
>
> **Do not search for her name online — you have the contact. Reach out
> directly. No need to document her identity here until a deal is signed.**

---

### The Business Model

**Three layers in the attorney directory:**

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 1 — FEATURED ATTORNEY  (the partner slot)    │
│  • Pinned to top of every attorney search result    │
│  • Shown by default when user clicks "Find Attorney"│
│  • Her firm's brand, bio, and booking link          │
│  • Paid placement (monthly retainer or rev-share)   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓  "Want to browse more options?"
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 2 — CURATED DIRECTORY  (future paid slots)   │
│  • Other vetted music/entertainment attorneys       │
│  • Can pay for boosted placement                    │
│  • indiiOS vets and approves each listing           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓  "Search the full directory"
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Layer 3 — OPEN SEARCH  (organic, no rev-share)     │
│  • General attorney search (state bar lookup, etc.) │
│  • No indiiOS endorsement, user finds their own     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### The Deal Structure to Propose

**Option A — Revenue Share (preferred for the pitch)**
- indiiOS gets X% of any client fees generated through the platform referral
- She gets prominent placement at zero upfront cost
- Both parties win as the user base grows
- Track referrals via a UTM-tagged booking link or a dedicated booking flow
  inside the app

**Option B — Flat Monthly Retainer**
- She pays a fixed monthly fee for the featured slot
- indiiOS revenue is predictable
- Better for her if client volume is high (she keeps 100% of fees)
- Risk: if the platform is early-stage, harder to justify the fee

**Option C — Hybrid (most likely to close)**
- Low/zero monthly fee at launch (reduces her risk while platform is early)
- Revenue share kicks in after a threshold (e.g., after she earns $X from
  referrals, indiiOS takes Y%)
- She gets "Founding Partner Attorney" title / co-marketing language
- Both sides have skin in the game

**The pitch hook:** Her YouTube audience is people who can't afford her
firm yet. indiiOS is the platform where those same people become paying
clients once they release their first record. She's already warming up
the exact user base indiiOS is targeting.

---

### What She Gets (the value prop for her)

1. **Inbound leads at scale** — every indiiOS user who clicks "Find an
   Attorney" sees her first, every time
2. **Credibility on the platform** — "Platform Legal Partner" badge,
   visible on legal pages, in the AI agent's responses, in onboarding
3. **Content angle** — she can use indiiOS in her YouTube videos as a
   real tool she endorses (not paid promo — actual partnership)
4. **Zero cold outreach** — she doesn't market to get these leads; they
   come from users mid-workflow (e.g., just after they generate a contract
   or hit the copyright registration step)
5. **First mover** — she'd be the named attorney partner while indiiOS is
   in beta, locking in the relationship before competitors notice

---

### What indiiOS Gets

1. **Legal credibility** — a recognizable music law brand attached to the
   platform; reduces user anxiety about "is this legit?"
2. **Marketing channel** — she demos the platform to her audience in
   exchange for the leads the platform sends her
3. **Revenue stream** — attorney directory becomes a monetizable layer
   (other attorneys can pay for placement in Layer 2)
4. **Retained users** — when a user finds their attorney inside the app,
   they don't leave the platform to handle their legal needs

---

### Engineering Spec — What Needs to Be Built

> File locations when implemented: `src/modules/legal/` for the UI,
> `src/services/legal/` for the directory logic, `python/tools/` for
> any attorney search agent tools.

**MVP (for the pitch — show her this exists):**
- [ ] Featured attorney card in `LegalPages.tsx` — name, firm, bio,
      photo, "Book a Consultation" button (deep links to her booking page)
- [ ] Pinned to top of any attorney search result in the Legal module
- [ ] Simple UTM-tagged link so referrals are trackable from day one

**Phase 2 (after deal is signed):**
- [ ] Booking flow inside the app (user picks time slot, fills intake form,
      submits without leaving indiiOS)
- [ ] Referral tracking dashboard (attorney-facing: how many leads came
      from indiiOS, conversion rate, client status)
- [ ] "Platform Legal Partner" badge + featured placement in AI agent
      responses when user asks "how do I find an attorney?"

**Phase 3 (attorney marketplace):**
- [ ] Layer 2 directory with paid attorney listings
- [ ] Attorney profile pages (specialty, state bar license, bio, reviews)
- [ ] Attorney search filtered by specialty (music IP, contract review,
      distribution, touring, etc.) and state

## Agent Tools — Music Rights Registries (Engineering Backlog)

> **Context:** The platform's browser agent tools currently support music
> distribution lookups. The following two registries need to be added as
> searchable/actionable tools in the agent layer so users can handle
> music rights directly from within indiiOS.

### Harry Fox Agency (HFA) / Songfile
- **What it is:** The primary US mechanical licensing agency. When someone
  wants to cover a song or use it in a recording, they get a mechanical
  license through HFA.
- **What the tool needs to do:** Allow a user to search HFA/Songfile for
  mechanical license availability, initiate a license request for a song
  they want to sample or cover, and track license status.
- **API / integration path:** HFA is now owned by SESAC. Check
  songfile.com for their API/affiliate program. Alternatively integrate
  via a mechanical licensing aggregator (Songclip, Musicbed, etc.).
- **File to update:** Add tool definition to `python/tools/` and register
  in the agent tool registry.

### Library of Congress — Copyright Registration
- **What it is:** The official US copyright registration system
  (copyright.gov). Registration is optional but required to sue for
  statutory damages and attorney fees if someone infringes your work.
- **What the tool needs to do:**
  1. Guide the user through pre-registration (checklist of what they need)
  2. Link directly to the eCO (Electronic Copyright Office) registration
     portal at copyright.gov/registration
  3. For AI-assisted works: prompt the user to declare human authorship
     contributions before registering (per Copyright Office Part 2 guidance,
     January 2025 — see AI Reference Card above)
  4. Track registration status by case number
- **Note:** The Copyright Office does not have a public API for automated
  filing. The tool should be a guided workflow + deep link, not a direct
  API integration.
- **File to update:** Add to `python/tools/` alongside the HFA tool.

**Priority:** Both tools are P1 — important for a full-service music
platform but not a launch blocker. Add to the engineering backlog.
