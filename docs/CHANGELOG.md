# Changelog

All notable changes to indiiOS are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Production Readiness & Security Audit

- **Critical Lint Remediation**: Resolved all blocking ESLint errors including `setState` in `useEffect` loops and render-cycle component creation bugs.
- **Security Hardening**:
  - Scrubbed hardcoded Firebase API keys and test credentials from scripts and application code.
  - Enforced strict environment variable usage in `src/config/env.ts` with runtime validation.
  - Verified Firebase Storage security rules via `the-auditor.ts` (confirmed referrer restrictions are active).
  - Manual audit of Electron security primitives (Node integration, Context isolation, Sandbox, CSP) confirmed compliance.
- **Stability Improvements**:
  - Refactored `MerchTable` to use `useCallback` for stable function references.
  - Implemented component caching in `AnimatedNumber` to prevent re-creation during render.
  - Fixed `@ts-expect-error` compliance in test scripts.

### Added (Previous)

#### Membership Tier System

- **MembershipService** (`src/services/MembershipService.ts`): Centralized tier management with limits for free, pro, and enterprise users
  - Video duration limits: 8 min (free), 60 min (pro), 4 hours (enterprise)
  - Daily image generation limits: 10/50/unlimited
  - Storage quotas: 100MB/5GB/100GB
  - Project limits: 3/25/unlimited
- **Video Editor Integration**: `videoEditorStore.ts` now enforces duration limits based on membership tier

#### Database Vacuum / Garbage Collection

- **CleanupService** (`src/services/CleanupService.ts`): Identifies and removes orphaned Firestore records
  - Dry-run scan mode to preview deletions before executing
  - Detects orphaned history items (referencing deleted projects)
  - Detects orphaned projects (referencing deleted organizations)
  - Optional Firebase Storage cleanup for orphaned files
  - Progress callbacks for UI integration
- **Dashboard Integration**: "Cleanup" button with confirmation modal showing scan results before deletion

#### Semantic Memory for Agents

- **ContextPipeline Enhancement** (`src/services/agent/components/ContextPipeline.ts`):
  - Auto-retrieves relevant memories from `MemoryService` based on conversation context
  - Extracts recent context (last 5 exchanges) for semantic similarity search
  - Formats memories into structured prompt section
- **AgentExecutor Update** (`src/services/agent/components/AgentExecutor.ts`):
  - Passes `memoryContext` and `relevantMemories` to agent execution
  - Logs when semantic memories are injected
- **BaseAgent Memory Injection** (`src/services/agent/BaseAgent.ts`):
  - Adds "RELEVANT MEMORIES" section to agent prompts when memories are available
  - Enables agents to maintain continuity across sessions

#### Project Export

- **ExportService** (`src/services/ExportService.ts`): Full project backup to ZIP format
  - Exports project metadata, history, and assets
  - Progress tracking integrated with Toast system
  - Automatic download trigger

#### Voice Control

- **VoiceService** (`src/services/ai/VoiceService.ts`): Web Speech API integration
  - Speech-to-text via `startListening(onResult, onError)`
  - Text-to-speech via `speak(text)`
  - Browser compatibility detection via `isSupported()`
- **CommandBar Integration**: Mic button for voice input
  - Visual feedback when listening (red pulse animation)
  - Transcribed text appends to input field
- **ChatOverlay Integration**: Auto-speak agent responses (when unmuted)
  - Mute/unmute toggle in chat overlay

#### Stress Testing

- **E2E Tests** (`e2e/stress-test.spec.ts`): Performance validation suite
  - Rendering performance test: Validates 30+ fps during rapid scroll
  - Asset loading performance test: Measures time-to-interactive
  - FPS metrics tracking with frame drop detection

### Changed

#### Cloud Architecture

- **Firebase Persistence** (`src/services/firebase.ts`): Updated to modern persistence API
  - Uses `persistentLocalCache` with `persistentMultipleTabManager`
  - Enables automatic offline support and multi-tab synchronization
  - Removed need for custom IndexedDB schema

#### Dashboard

- Added Export button on project cards for ZIP backup
- Added Cleanup button in header for database maintenance

### Removed

- **SCHEMA_UPGRADE_NOTES.md**: Obsolete IndexedDB migration planning document (cloud-first architecture)
