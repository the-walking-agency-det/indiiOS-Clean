## 2025-05-22 - Connected Leaf Components for High-Frequency Updates
**Learning:** Extracting high-frequency UI elements (like a video playhead) into small, self-connected components prevents their heavy parents from re-rendering on every update.
**Action:** Identify components that receive rapidly changing props (e.g., `currentTime`, `scrollPosition`) and extract the specific dynamic part into a separate component that subscribes directly to the store.
## 2025-05-22 - Video List Optimization
**Learning:** For lists of video elements, using `preload='metadata'` drastically reduces memory usage compared to default preloading. Interactive 'play-on-hover' provides a better UX than static thumbnails while maintaining performance.
**Action:** Apply `preload='metadata'` and `muted` to all list-based video components and implement hover-to-play patterns.
## 2025-05-22 - Firestore Snapshot Reference Instability
**Learning:** Firestore `onSnapshot` maps often create new object references for every document on every update (even unchanged ones). `React.memo`'s default shallow comparison fails here, causing full list re-renders.
**Action:** Implement `arePropsEqual` deep comparison for list items fed by Firestore subscriptions to skip renders when data content is identical despite reference changes.
## 2025-05-22 - Firestore Snapshot Instability
**Learning:** Firestore `onSnapshot` listeners combined with `doc.data()` mapping often generate new object references for *every* document on every update, breaking `React.memo`'s default shallow comparison.
**Action:** Always implement a custom `arePropsEqual` deep comparison function for list items rendered from real-time Firestore collections to prevent full-list re-renders when single items change.
## 2025-05-24 - Zustand Store Selectors
**Learning:** Calling `useStore()` without selectors subscribes the component to the entire state tree. This causes re-renders on *any* state change (even unrelated ones), which is a critical bottleneck for complex root components like `VideoWorkflow`.
**Action:** Always use granular selectors (e.g., `useStore(useShallow(state => ({ ... })))`) to subscribe only to the specific state slices a component actually needs.
## 2025-05-24 - Duplicate useEffect Hooks
**Learning:** Large components often accumulate duplicate 'setup' effects over time (e.g. from partial refactors), causing double-fetching of data on mount.
**Action:** Audit complex components for multiple `useEffect` hooks with identical dependency arrays and consolidate them.
